# FMcouter

Find out the strengths and weaknesses of a soccer player using massive amounts of Football Manager (FM) data.
To learn about players that you are unfamiliar with, you usually need to search them up on Google or look for highlight videos. You can also find out the advantages or disadvantages of a player simply through how they are rated on soccer games, but this is also impossible if the game is not installed in your computer.

This chrome extension allows you to browse the profile of a player summarized based on the data in Football Manager, which is considered to be the game that reflects the players' abilities pretty accurately.

## How it Works

- Whenever you read a soccer article and want to know more about the player that is mentioned in the article, select the name of the player, right-click and select FMcouter, then the player's summary profile will pop up.

- If the search result is incorrect, press the "Wrong Player?" Button on the upper left corner to go to the screen where you can search for the player by name. For accurate search, it is recommended to search by full name in English.
